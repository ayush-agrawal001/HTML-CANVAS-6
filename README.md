## Interactive Particle Collision Simulation

This repository contains a JavaScript simulation of particles moving within a canvas, where they interact with each other and with the canvas edges through collisions. 
The simulation includes features such as elastic collisions, dynamic resizing of the canvas, and colorful particle representations.

### Features:

- **Particle Interactions**: The particles exhibit realistic elastic collisions when they encounter each other, resulting in changes in velocity and direction.
- **Canvas Resizing**: The canvas automatically adjusts its size to match the window dimensions, providing a responsive user experience.
- **Colorful Representation**: Each particle is represented by a colorful circle, with a variety of colors generated randomly from a predefined color array.
- **Customizable**: Users can customize the number of particles, their initial velocities, and the canvas dimensions to create diverse simulations.
